# .NET_MicroservicesDemo
This project is a demo for a mini system based on microservice architecture. 
The following steps have been taken in this project: 
• Building two .NET Microservices using the REST API pattern 
• Working with dedicated persistence layers for both services 
• Deploying our services to Kubernetes cluster 
• Employing the API Gateway pattern to route to our services 
• Building Synchronous messaging between services (HTTP &amp; gRPC) 
• Building Asynchronous messaging between services using an Event Bus (RabbitMQ)

Technological stack used here: .NET Core 5, Docker, Kubernetes, RabbitMq, HTTP, Grpc, Event Processing.
