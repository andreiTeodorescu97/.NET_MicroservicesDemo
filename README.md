# .NET_MicroservicesDemo
This project is a demo for a mini system based on microservice architecture. <br />
The following steps have been taken in this project: <br />
• Building two .NET Microservices using the REST API pattern  <br />
• Working with dedicated persistence layers for both services <br />
• Deploying our services to Kubernetes cluster <br />
• Employing the API Gateway pattern to route to our services <br />
• Building Synchronous messaging between services (HTTP &amp; gRPC) <br />
• Building Asynchronous messaging between services using an Event Bus (RabbitMQ) <br />

Technological stack used here: .NET Core 5, Docker, Kubernetes, RabbitMq, HTTP, Grpc, Event Processing.
